# Some information about the plugin

In addition, a gui has been made for the plugin, you can choose the anti cheat features one by one and turn them on or off as you wish.
Anti cheat is very successful in combat detection, but movement detection needs to be improved a little more, you can improve it if you want, the project is regular enough.
